##About
A Docker Image providing [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) and the latest version of [winetricks](http://www.winetricks.org).

When running a container from this image and linked to a container based on [suchja/x11server](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/suchja/x11server/), all graphical output from wine can be seen via VNC client.

##Usage
Starting a container from this image can be done as follows:

`docker run --rm -it --link display:xserver --volumes-from display suchja/wine /bin/bash`

The `--link display:xserver` and `--volumes-from display` option is only required, if graphical output from wine shall be shown via [suchja/x11server](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/suchja/x11server/). Otherwise these two options can be omitted. Then `wine` will show warning messages, because it is not able to display graphical output.

For the above container to properly run, you must first start the x11server container:

`docker run -d --name display -e VNC_PASSWORD=newPW -p 5900:5900 suchja/x11server`

###Initialize wine
There is no initialized wine prefix in the container. Thus your first action in the container should be something like:

`wine wineboot --init`

This will give you warnings indicating that the X server is not running or that $DISPLAY is not defined, if you have not properly linked to a running container of [suchja/x11server](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/suchja/x11server/). Obviously this is okay and can be ignored, if Wine is only used to run console applications.

Out of the box Wine is configured to run a 32-bit Windows (`WINEARCH=win32`). You can change this by setting the environment variable `WINEARCH` to nothing before you initialize your prefix. Simply type the following command:

`export WINEARCH=''`

Now your wine bottle is ready to be tasted.

###Start using wine
After initializing your Wine prefix you can verify that it is properly running by starting Notepad:

`wine notepad.exe`

This only works if you have attached an X server. If you like to run a console application, it is now time to add it to the container. You can do this from the command line within the running wine container, or you bind-mount a volume from your host into the container, which contains the application you like to execute.

For me the above command resulted in seeing Notepad, but without the window title (including the options to close the window). It seems that this can be fixed by telling wine to emualte a virtual desktop. Therefore the container includes the command `winegui`. This is an alias, which calls `wine` with some additional arguments and can be used like this:

`winegui notpad.exe`

##Known problems
While using this image in combination with [suchja/x11server](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/suchja/x11server/) I experienced the following problems.

###X error ... BadValue
From time to time I have seen the following error message after executing a wine command (mostly after the first `wine wineboot --init`):

```
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  130 (MIT-SHM)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage)
  Value in failed request:  0x140
  Serial number of failed request:  213
  Current serial number in output stream:  219
```

I haven't figured out the exact reason for it, but it seems that it is somehow related to the remote X server. As far as I can tell it does not have any impact, but maybe somebody with more knowledge about X Window and/or Wine can point me into the right direction.

##Maintenance
I do not have a dedicated maintenance schedule for this image. In case a new stable version of Wine is released, I might update the image accordingly.

If you experience any problems with the image, open up an issue on the [source repository](https://github.com/suchja/wine). I'll look into it as soon as possible.
